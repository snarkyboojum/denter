Denter is a simple little command line identi.ca client written in Perl 6.

You must put a plaintext username and password in .credentials in the
current directory (currently). I don't expect many people to use this :)

Usage: perl6 dent "Perl 6 can talk HTTP with Basic Auth!"

Denter currently has the following dependencies:

 - HTTP::Client at http://github.com/snarkyboojum/http-client
   (this is a fork of the original HTTP::Client written by carlins at
    http://github.com/carlins/http-client).

 - MIME::Base64 at http://github.com/snarkyboojum/Perl6-MIME-Base64
